environment. Within this pipeline, we have several environments that mimics our environment. The following environment<br>
are divided into two subscriptions - Non-prod and prod <br>
Each subscription has a service (Azure Webapp) that is divided into two environments (default deployment slot and final deployment slot)<br>
This pipeline accounts for different attributes like cacheing, environment manual required approval, ITSM integration, A&B deployment strategy with traffic quota sharing of 30% at the initial slot.
